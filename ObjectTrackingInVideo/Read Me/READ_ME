The WebCam ObjectTracking application track objects by its color.  We just have to supply the path for the video.  There's a folder with videos to use the application.

To run this file, the working directory might be ObjectTrackingInVideo.  To achieve this, open the command line and type:

cd Documents/Practice/Applications/ObjectTrackingInVideo
